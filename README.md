The official start to my 100 html/css challenge.  The first challenge will be the google homepage.  Idea was from the opening curriculum of the odin project. Started off the project by using a reference picture.  Using that picture I was able to first structure the html.  Once I properly structured the html and ordered my divs and sections I was then able to start styling.  Not to bore too much on each individual piece the majority of the styling and positioning was used with flex box.  I believe that grid would have probably been easier but that may simply be because I am very comfortable with it.  the Majority of the positioning was pretty easy until the end of the project.

Working on the footer provided a lot of challenges for me.  the main issues was making sure that the main portion of the google page was long enough and making sure that the footer wasn't too long that it cause the need to scroll.  I wanted the page to all fit in the display window.  Maybe on my next approach I will research a way to properly have the entire view height accounted for.  Doing this earlier in the project may help me save time rather that doing it by trial and error change and refresh. I know I am very far away from mastering css styling and the positioning skills need to develop a lot more especially when I take on more layout projects that are much more involved like shapes or overlapping sections.
